This code defines a Java class named GrayPaintScale in the package org.jfree.chart.renderer, 
which is intended for use with JFreeChart, a free Java chart library. 
The class implements a paint scale that generates shades of gray based on a specified value within a defined range.
Here's a summary of its key components and functionality:

Implements Interfaces:
	PaintScale, for defining a paint scale, 
	PublicCloneable to allow cloning of the instance, 
	and Serializable to enable serialization of instances of this class.

Fields:
	It has two private double fields, lowerBound and upperBound, which define the range of values the scale handles.

Constructors:

	A no-argument constructor that sets the default range from 0.0 to 1.0.
	A constructor that takes two arguments, lowerBound and upperBound, for custom ranges. 
		It throws an IllegalArgumentException if lowerBound is not less than upperBound.

Methods:
	getLowerBound() and getUpperBound() return the lower and upper bounds of the scale, respectively.
	getPaint(double value) returns a Paint object (specifically a Color) corresponding to a shade of gray based on the specified value.
		The shade is calculated proportionally within the scale's range, where the lower bound maps to black, the upper bound to white,
		and intermediate values to corresponding shades of gray.
	equals(Object obj) checks if another object is equal to this GrayPaintScale instance, based on the lower and upper bounds.
	clone() provides support for cloning the instance, leveraging the clone method from the Object class.
	The class is designed to be used within the context of JFreeChart for generating grayscale colors dynamically based on data values,
		which is useful for applications like creating grayscale heat maps or charts
		where different shades of gray represent different data values.
